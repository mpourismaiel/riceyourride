Amazing framework to create dynamic GTK windows using Javascript with built-in services that handles various APIs such as notification, Hyprland IPC and more.

AGS is massively expandable and can be used in any Wayland environment.

X11 support is planned and being discussed [here](https://github.com/Aylur/ags/issues/19).
